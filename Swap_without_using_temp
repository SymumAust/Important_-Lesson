Swap === without taking extra variable
--------------------------------

Using Arithmetic Operations:

a = a + b
b = a - b
a = a - b



------------------
taking X-OR

Using Bitwise XOR (^):

a = a ^ b
b = a ^ b
a = a ^ b

---> This works because XOR (^) of two same numbers gives 0. So, 
in the first line, a becomes a ^ b, 
in the second line, b becomes a ^ b ^ b, which is a, 
and in the third line, a becomes a ^ b ^ a, which is b.
